        intended permissions. Failures typically lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification, 
        or destruction of all data or performing a business function outside the user's limits. Common access control 
        vulnerabilities include: </P>
      
      
      
      
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Violation of the principle of least privilege or deny by default, where access should only
           be granted for particular capabilities, roles, or users, but is available to anyone. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      
      
      <ul>

          Bypassing access control checks by modifying the URL

          or the HTML page, or by using an attack tool modifying API requests.

      <ul>

          Permitting viewing or editing someone else's account, by providing

          Accessing API with missing access controls for POST, PUT and DELETE.

      </ul>
      
      
      
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Elevation of privilege. Acting as a user without being logged in or acting
           as an admin when logged in as a user.   
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      
      
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          Metadata manipulation, such as replaying or tampering with a JSON Web Token
           (JWT) access control token, or a cookie or hidden field manipulated to elevate 
           privileges or abusing JWT invalidation.

      <li>Whenever we make an account on a website, we are given a unique ID. By using that ID, we can access the database where all our sensitive contents are saved.
      </li>
          <p> For example: </p>
      <p>Suppose, you have logged into a website, and your user ID is 986. The URL of your profile page should look something like this: https://brokenaccesscontrol.com/profile?id=986.
         We have to keep in mind that, like you, everyone else who makes his/her account on that website, is given a unique user ID. So, if you replace your ID with someone else’s user ID, 
         then you can get access to his/her profile. Yes, this can happen if access control is not properly implemented in the server. </p>
      
      
      
      <li>
        Hackers can take advantage of access flaws to gain access to the resources and services that should not be accessible to normal users 
      </li>   
      
      <p> For Example: </p>
      <p>the admin page of a web application should only be accessible to the admin, and shouldn’t be available to any other user. However, if the access control is broken then hackers can 
        easily get access to it just by making some changes in the URL. With that privilege, they can steal other users’ data or deploy malicious payloads to destroy the entire application hosting ecosystem. </p>
      
      
      <li>
         There are possibilities of Distributed Denial of Service attacks (DDOS). With access to those user accounts, attackers can attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, by deploying bots.
         This makes it difficult for the server to distinguish legitimate user traffic from attack traffic.

<div class="para well">
</p>
    <ul><li>
     <P>The main vulnerability to an injection attack is data not being kept separate from commands and queries. Here is what can be done to prevent an injection: 
     </li> </ul>


     <ul><li>
      The most common solution is the use of a safe API that avoids the use of the interpreter altogether or uses parameterized queries or migrates to Object Relational Mapping Tools (ORMs). Note that parametrized stored procedures can still be vulnerable to an SQL injection if queries and data are concatenated or hostile data is executed with EXECUTE IMMEDIATE or exec() 
     </li></ul>


      <ul><li>
      Use positive server-side input validation (whitelist) – this is a partial defense since many applications require the use of special characters 
     </li></ul>


      <ul><li>
      For residual dynamic queries, special characters can be avoided via the specific escape syntax for that interpreter 
     </li></ul>

      <ul><li>
      Use database controls within queries such as LIMIT to prevent mass exposure of data if an SQL injection is successful 
     </li></ul>

        <ul><li>
      Run a  SQL Injection Test or XSS Test by an atomated vulnerability tool such as Crashtest Security Suite (now 14-day Free Trial in it’s full version), which will inform you about every weaknesses and attacks vectors discovered in your web app or API. </P>

    <li> Maintain an inventory of components you are using and ensure that they are kept up-to-date.</li>
  </ul>
  
  
  <ul>
    <li> Remove unused dependencies and components to reduce the attack surface and your liabilities (yes,

  </ul>
  
  
  <ul>
    <li> Be on the lookout for any security patches for the components you are relying on. 
      If the packages you use are not maintained, then either make sure you apply patches yourself 
      or use some alternate component that is well maintained and has a big user-base and supporting community.
       If possible, then this should actually be done right from the start — choose your dependencies and components wisely! </li>

  <p><strong>EXAMPLE</strong></p>
  
  <li><strong> Heartbleed code </strong></li>
  <p>The coding mistake that caused Heartbleed can be traced to a single line of code:

  <p>memcpy() is the command that copies data. bp is the place it's copying it to, pl 
    is where it's being copied from, and payload is the length of the data being copied.
     The problem is that there's never any attempt to check if the amount of data in pl is 
     equal to the value given of payload. </p>
  
  
  
  
  
  <li><strong>The Heartbleed fix </strong></li>
  <p>The way to fix the Heartbleed vulnerability is to upgrade to the latest version of OpenSSL</p>

<p class="head"><strong></p>Identification & Authentication Failures</strong> This class of vulnerability covers any weaknesses in the authentication/session management 
methodology. These are often poorly implemented in web apps, giving attackers access to account(s) and/or data that they otherwise shouldn’t be 
authorized to view.  

<h3 class="head">PRIVILEGE ESCALATION</h3>

<P  class="well para">Privilege escalation attacks progressively increase their access to computer systems by exploiting
 its security vulnerabilities. They are classified into horizontal and vertical privilege escalation attacks
  based on the attack's strategy and objective. Privilege escalation attacks may also have general targets like 
  an entire system or networks, but the attack can also be more focused such as a particular user or application. 
  A variety of specific privilege escalation attacks exist, each of which exploits a different set of vulnerabilities
   and has its own set of technical requirements. The methods of preventing these privilege escalation attacks include
    both general and specific practices. </P>


<h3 class="head">TYPES OF PRIVILEGE ESCALATION ATTACKS:</h3><hr>

<div class="head">Horizontal Privilege Escalation</div>
<p class="well para">Horizontal privilege escalation involves the attacker gaining access to a user account and increasing the permissions 
on that account. This type of privilege escalation is typically more challenging, as it generally requires a greater 
understanding of the system's vulnerabilities and the greater use of hacking tools like Metasploit. Attackers often use
 phishing campaigns to perform the first step of gaining access to an account. </p>




<div class="head">Vertical Privilege Escalation</div>
<p class="well para">Vertical privilege escalation occurs when attackers gain direct access to an account that already has the privileges
 needed to accomplish their goal. This type of privilege escalation is easier to perform since it doesn't require any 
 steps beyond this. In this case, the attack focuses on identifying an account with the necessary privileges and obtaining 
 access to that account. </p>

    <p><strong>What's the most exceedingly awful thing that could happen when you experience a SQL infusion assault?</strong></p>

<p>Many websites hold sensitive data on behalf of their users. If an attacker can exploit horizontal escalation vulnerabilities
 to gain access to another user’s data, you are betraying your users’ trust, which can have reputational, legal, and financial 
 implications.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>1. Password policies </strong>,It is essential to ensure users select unique, secure passwords and force them to change
passwords periodically. Because this is difficult to enforce in practice, a good way to circumvent the insecure nature of passwords 
is to apply two-factor authentication, especially for sensitive systems and administrative accounts. </li>
<li>



<strong>2. Specialized users and groups with minimum privileges </strong>Review your user base and redefine user accounts and groups to
ensure they have clear roles, applying the minimum necessary privileges and file access to each role. By doing this, you ensure that even
if an account is compromised, the potential for privilege escalation is severely limited. This applies to all accounts — even admins and
 super-users should have limited access to the systems they are actually supposed to access or manage. No administrator should have broad
  permissions for most or all network systems. 



Most importantly — remove user accounts when they are no longer needed, and have a clear, mandatory procedure for dealing with employee departure. 

</li>



<li>

<strong>3. Close unused ports and limit file access </strong>, Network ports should be blocked by default and only allowed if they are really needed
for legitimate applications. Identify default configurations that have unnecessary services running, and block them. In the same way, files should be 
read-only, with write access only enabled for users and groups who actually need them. </li>



<li>

<strong>4. Secure databases and sanitize user inputs  </strong>,Many database systems have insecure defaults, so special care must be taken to
ensure databases are secured and protected by strong authentication. Data at rest should be encrypted whenever possible. Sanitize all user inputs 
and patch databases to prevent SQL and other code injection attacks. </li>
</li>






<li>
<strong>5. Keep your systems and applications patched and updated </strong>, Many privilege escalation attacks leverage software vulnerabilities 
to gain initial access. Use vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in your applications, and rigorously apply security patches to
remediate them. Because it is not always possible or practical to patch or update systems, especially large-scale production systems or legacy components, 
you may need to apply additional layers of security. For example, a web application firewall (WAF) can identify and block malicious communication related to
 a vulnerability exploit at the network level, even if the underlying system was not patched.  </li>
</li>




<li>
<strong>6. Change default credentials on all devices  </strong>, Be sure to remove or rename default and unused user accounts. Change the default
login credentials for any hardware system, including printers, routers, and IoT devices. A single device with default credentials and an open network 
port can become an initial access point for an attacker, leading to a privilege escalation attack. </li>

          Be aware that rate limits can be bypassed by using a large network of IPs which are widely and easily available to most seasoned attackers. They can also be bypassed with
           “low and slow” attacks, where requests are sent over a long period of time.  </li>

  <h3 class="head" id="Session Fixation">Session Fixation</h3><hr>
  <h3 class="head">Description</h3>


<p  class="well">Session Fixation is an attack technique that forces a user's session ID 
to an explicit value. Depending on the functionality of the target web site, a number of techniques can
 be utilized to "fix" the session ID value. These techniques range from Cross-site Scripting exploits to peppering
  the web site with previously made HTTP requests. After a user's session ID has been fixed, the attacker will wait for 
  that user to login. Once the user does so, the attacker uses the predefined session ID value to assume the same online identity. </p>


  <h3 class="head">RISK:</h3>
<p class="para well" >session fixation attacks attempt to exploit the vulnerability of a system that allows one person to fixate (find or set) another person's 
session identifier. Most session fixation attacks are web based, and most rely on session identifiers being accepted from URLs (query string)
 or POST data.</p>

 <h3 class="head">MITIGATION</h3>
 <div class="para well">
<p>The only causes of session fixation are insufficient web application security and bad coding practices associated with session management: </p>


<ul>
<li>

  In the worst case, developers don’t check the validity of session identifiers and any string (or any string of a specific format) 
  may be provided as a session ID. This makes session fixation attacks trivial.
</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li>

  Very often, developers assign the session ID before the user 
  is logged in and never change it. This is the main cause of typical session fixation attacks. 
</li>
</ul>





<ul>
<li>
  If developers accept session IDs from GET or POST requests, they make it easier
   for the attacker to forcefully set a session ID for the user. 
  
</li>
</ul>


<p>There are several ways to avoid session fixation vulnerabilities: </p>

<ul>
<li>
  The standard method is to change the session ID right after the user logs in. 
  This eliminates most session fixation vulnerabilities.  
</li>
</ul>




<ul>
<li>
  An additional countermeasure is to change the session ID with the slightest suspicion of potential wrongdoing. 
  For example, the web application may test whether the IP address or the user-agent of the client changed and if it did – provide a new session ID.  
</li>
</ul>






<ul>
<li>
  You should also invalidate session IDs after a timeout. For example, 10 minutes of no activity should cause an automatic logout. This gives the attacker a 
  small window of opportunity to use the fixed session ID  
</li>
</ul>





<ul>
<li>
  Some sources recommend changing the session IDs with every user action. However, this is a drastic, unnecessary, 
  and potentially harmful – it may impact user experience and performance (for example, it might be impossible when using applets). To minimize the impact, you may change 
  the session ID before every important user action on the website.    
</li>
</ul>






<ul>
<li>
  Remember to use session cookies for session management 
  and do not accept session IDs from HTTP requests and HTTP headers. 
</li>
</ul>

<p  class="well">A web session is a set of HTTP transactions issued by a user within a given time frame. Web applications use sessions to retain information about each user,
 keep track of their activity or define proper access rights and permissions. Each session has an identifier (token or ID) defined by the application

<p class="well para"> Software and data integrity failures relate to code and infrastructure that does not protect against integrity violations.
   An example of this is where an application relies upon plugins, libraries, or modules from untrusted sources, repositories, and content
    delivery networks (CDNs). An insecure CI/CD pipeline can introduce the potential for unauthorized access, malicious code, or system compromise.
     Lastly, many applications now include auto-update functionality, where updates are downloaded without sufficient integrity verification and applied
      to the previously trusted application. Attackers could potentially upload their own updates to be distributed and run on all installations.
       Another example is where objects or data are encoded or serialized into a structure that an attacker can see and modify is vulnerable to

<p class="para well">
  <strong>Scenario #1:</strong> A children's health plan provider's website operator couldn't detect a breach due to a lack of
   monitoring and logging. An external party informed the health plan provider that an attacker had accessed and 
   modified thousands of sensitive health records of more than 3.5 million children. A post-incident review found 
   that the website developers had not addressed significant vulnerabilities. As there was no logging or monitoring of the system,
    the data breach could have been in progress since 2013, a period of more than seven years.

<h3 class="head" "> Why is server-side request forgery dangerous? </h3>
<p class="well para">While many web vulnerabilities directly affect the target system, SSRF allows attackers to use the target as an intermediary that passes requests to a 
  third system. So while an SSRF attack might not be damaging in itself, it can provide malicious hackers with access to internal systems that were never supposed to be accessible from 
  the Internet. There are several reasons why this is dangerous</p>

<p class="head">How to Prevent</p>
<p>Developers can prevent SSRF by implementing some or all the following defense in depth controls: </p>
<div class="well para">
<ul><strong>From Network layer</strong> </ul>

<li>Segment remote resource access functionality in separate networks to reduce the impact of SSRF </li>

<li>Enforce “deny by default” firewall policies or network access control rules to block all but essential intranet traffic.</li>





<p>
</div>
<div class="well para">
<ul><strong> From Application layer: </strong></ul>
<li>Sanitize and validate all client-supplied input data </li>
<li>Enforce the URL schema, port, and destination with a positive allow list </li>
<li>Do not send raw responses to clients</li>
<li>Disable HTTP redirections </li>
<li>Be aware of the URL consistency to avoid attacks such as DNS rebinding and “time of check, time of use” (TOCTOU) race conditions</li>
</p>


<p>
</div>
<div class="well para">
<ul><strong> Additional Measures to consider: </strong></ul>
<li>Don't deploy other security relevant services on front systems (e.g., OpenID). Control local traffic on these systems (e.g., localhost) </li>
<li>For frontends with dedicated and manageable user groups use network encryption (e.g., VPNs) on independent systems to consider very high protection needs </li>      
</p>



</div>

<h3 class="head">What are the potential impacts of SSRF attacks?:</h3>
<div class="para well">
<p>The direct impact of exploiting a server-side request forgery vulnerability is nearly always information disclosure because attackers obtain a lot of useful 
  information about systems and resources that should be inaccessible to them. However, the indirect consequences can be devastating, since SSRF can allow malicious actors to: </p>

<ul>
  <li> Use the vulnerable server as a port and IP scanner for internal and external systems </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Interact with protocols such as Gopher (if enabled) to perform additional reconnaissance </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Discover the IP addresses of servers running behind a reverse proxy  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li> Obtain remote code execution </li>
</ul>




</div>

<p class="head">Example Attack Scenarios:</p>
<div class="para well">
<p>Attackers can use SSRF to attack systems protected behind web application firewalls, firewalls, or network ACLs, using scenarios such as: </p>

<ul>
  <p><strong>Scenario #1:</strong> Port scan internal servers – If the network architecture is unsegmented, attackers can map out internal networks and determine 
    if ports are open or closed on internal servers from connection results or elapsed time to connect or reject SSRF payload connections.</p>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="para well">
<ul>
  <p><strong>Scenario #2:</strong>Sensitive data exposure – Attackers can access local files such as or internal services to gain sensitive information such as file:///etc/passwd</span> and http://localhost:28017/. </p>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="para well">
<ul>
  <p><strong>Scenario #3:</strong>Access metadata storage of cloud services – Most cloud providers have metadata storage such as http://169.254.169.254/. An attacker can read the metadata to gain sensitive information. </p>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="para well">
<ul>
  <p><strong>Scenario #4:</strong>Compromise internal services – The attacker can abuse internal services to conduct further attacks such as Remote Code Execution (RCE) or Denial of Service (DoS).</p>
</ul>
